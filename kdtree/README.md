Type `make`, executable will end up in `bin`. You can run the executable from any directory. Don't use the
`Makefile` inside of `src`, use the one in the root of the project.

If you want verbose output, I have a flag currently set to `false` in `driver::main()`. Feel free to flip in on and recompile the code
if that's at all helpful for you. Line 51 of `driver.cpp`.

Don't pass 0 as the `num_cores` argument on the command line.
